# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OrionDAO seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Contact Us Privately

Send an email to security@oriondao.io with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
   - Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
   - Timelock delays for treasury transactions

2. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - ReentrancyGuard on all external payable functions
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

3. **Token Locking**
   - Votes require token locking during voting period
   - Prevents vote manipulation through buy-vote-sell

4. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive parameter checks
   - Zero address prevention
   - Range validations

5. **Upgrade Safety**
   - Immutable core contracts
   - Upgradeable only through governance
   - Emergency pause mechanism

### Audit Status

- **Internal Audit**: Completed
- **External Audit**: Pending
- **Bug Bounty**: Active

### Known Limitations

1. Oracle dependency for reputation updates
2. IPFS availability for proposal metadata
3. Gas costs during high network activity

## Best Practices for Users

### For DAO Members

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Use hardware wallets for large holdings
   - Enable multi-factor authentication
   - Keep seed phrases offline

2. **Voting Safely**
   - Verify proposal details on IPFS
   - Check contract addresses
   - Use adequate gas limits

3. **Token Management**
   - Monitor locked token balances
   - Claim unlocked tokens after voting
   - Be aware of market volatility

### For Developers

1. **Testing**
   - Run full test suite before deployment
   - Test on testnets first
   - Verify contract source code

2. **Integration**
   - Use latest contract ABIs
   - Implement error handling
   - Monitor transaction confirmations

3. **Key Management**
   - Never commit private keys
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement key rotation
